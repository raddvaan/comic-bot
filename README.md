# comic-bot
A simple digital comic book sorting program for windows written in python.
Comic Bot is a program designed to organise digital comic books according to Publisher, Series, Event, and Year. 
It's designed to be easy to use and intuitive.
Originally designed for personal use in sorting my archive of legally scanned comics.
